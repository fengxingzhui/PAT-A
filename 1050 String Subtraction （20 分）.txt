1050 String Subtraction （20 分）
Given two strings S1  and S2 , S=S​1 −S2  is defined to be the remaining string after taking all the characters in S2  from S1 . 
Your task is simply to calculate S1 −S2  for any given strings. However, it might not be that simple to do it fast.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two lines which gives S​1  and S2 , respectively. The string lengths of both strings are no more than 10^4 . 
It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a string.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print S1 −S2  in one line.

Sample Input:
They are students.

Sample Output:
Thy r stdnts.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int a[300]={};
	string s1,s2;
	getline(cin,s1);
	getline(cin,s2);
	for(int i=0;i<s2.size();i++) a[s2[i]]++;
	for(int i=0;i<s1.size();i++)
	{
		if(!a[s1[i]]) printf("%c",s1[i]);
	}
}
