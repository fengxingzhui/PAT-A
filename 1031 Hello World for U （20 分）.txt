1031 Hello World for U （20 分）
Given any string of N (≥5) characters, you are asked to form the characters into the shape of U. For example, helloworld can be printed as:

h  d
e  l
l  r
lowo
That is, the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-down from the left vertical line with n1 characters, then left to right along the bottom line with n2 characters, 
and finally bottom-up along the vertical line with n3 characters. And more, we would like U to be as squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that n​1=n3=max { k | k≤n2 for all 3≤n2≤N } with n1 + n2+ n3 −2=N.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains one string with no less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line. The string contains no white space.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in the description.

Sample Input:
helloworld!
Sample Output:
h   !
e   d
l   l
lowor
