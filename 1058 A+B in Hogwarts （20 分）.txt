1058 A+B in Hogwarts （20 分）
If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough." 
Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of Galleon.Sickle.Knut (Galleon is an integer in [0,10^7​​ ], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space.

Output Specification:
For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.

Sample Input:
3.2.1 10.16.27
Sample Output:
14.1.28

注意点：就是要用long long int ，貌似计算中途不会自动把int转换成long long，总之一开始long long就对了

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	long long int a1,b1;
	int c1,a2,b2,c2;
	scanf("%lld.%lld.%d %d.%d.%d",&a1,&b1,&c1,&a2,&b2,&c2);
	long long int num = (a1+a2)*17*29+(b1+b2)*29+c1+c2;
	printf("%lld.%lld.%lld",num/(17*29),num%(17*29)/29,num%29);
}
